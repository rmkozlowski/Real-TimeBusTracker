# Real-TimeBusTracker
Description:
In this assignment, we used the open source platform, mapbox, to display a map that shows the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. We used the MBTA bus data to determine the stops and then added an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes. 

How to run:
Once all files are opened (Index.html, mapanimation.js, styles.css) the code is programmed with all the stops and an interactive map. The user can zoom in and zoom out to better visualize the marked location and plan their routes. 

Road-map:
To make this program stronger, once could write a feature that calculates the distance from stop to stop. It would be interesting to incorporate exact times of the stops, as well.
